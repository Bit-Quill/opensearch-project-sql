# Overview

The OpenSearch SQL plugin provides a thin-client language-processing engine from SQL to an OpenSeach instance.  The SQL
language is a relational language that provides the JOIN feature to relate tables together by field or expression.  OpenSearch
offers a similar relation mapping within an index, that allows users to relate same-index documents using a parent-child
relation.

This proposal is to outline the limits of a same-table (ie same-index) join relation from SQL grammar, and provide use
cases for same-table JOINs.

# Same-Table Joins Query Design

OpenSearch provides a schema-flexible indexing solution with a 'join' object type (see: [join fields](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/field-types/join/)) 
that allows users to simulate join relations. There are a couple of restrictions on the join field relations: mainly,
only one relation is allowed per index, and the relations are parent-child relations. 

Joins in a SQL context aim to join relations between two separate tables, and merge them into a single result table. OpenSearch
can do the same relation join within a single index. This proposal provides syntax to join data within a single index
together into a single result set.  

## 1. Motivation

[[FEATURE] Support for subqueries or chaining of queries](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql/issues/1441) describes
an example use-case where we may want to join logs within a single index that have a common request or application identifier.

## 3. Assumptions/Dependencies

* _shard must be defined for any query using a same-table join
* Same-Table joins requires that the following work is complete:
    * Table/Indices can be aliased, for example: `SELECT t.fieldA, t.fieldB FROM table t WHERE t.fieldA = t.fieldB`

### 3.1 Out of Scope

* Fix for implicit JOINs [[BUG] implicit join returns wrong results](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql/issues/683)
* Fix for _shard or _routing [[FEATURE] Allow individual shards to be targeted during query execution](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql/issues/1478)
* Performance on the OpenSearch side
* Multiple-shard queries using `join`
* `join` using lateral-table support [PartiQL support in OpenSearch SQL V2](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql/issues/1104)
* Pagination using `join` or other complex types

### 3.2 Design Decisions

* JOIN-relations architecture is built to work in combination with the `nested` and `object` data types.  This allows enables
  both same-table joins and nested object (using PartiQL) to share execution paths and syntax.  This also enables a shared
  solution to expand support for `lateral` tables and enable `lateral join` and `lateral nested` queries.

                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Case SELECT... FROM... JOIN USING parent relation

Summary:
The JOIN USING syntax is a shortcut syntax for the ON (relation.parent) syntax, and only works when the relation only contains
a single parent: child relation.  If multiple relations are defined, the USING syntax is ambiguous and a semantic error
needs to throw for the user to correct the syntax.

The results of this example are exactly the same as case 4.1, but only works with a mapping that is simplified.  The following
mapping change is needed from the demo mapping provided in annex A. 

Mapping data:
```json
      "house_relation": {
        "type": "join",
        "relations": {
          "house": "member"
        }
      },
```

Example query (SQL):
```sql
SELECT *
FROM got AS m
JOIN got as h USING house_relation
WHERE h.house.name = "Targaryan"
```

        )?                                                                  #innerJoin
    // | STRAIGHT_JOIN tableSourceItem (ON expression)?                #straightJoin
    // | (LEFT | RIGHT) OUTER? JOIN LATERAL? tableSourceItem
    //     (
    //       ON expression
    //       | USING '(' uidList ')'
    //     )                                                           #outerJoin
    // | NATURAL ((LEFT | RIGHT) OUTER?)? JOIN tableSourceItem         #naturalJoin
    ;
```

The above grammar contains commented out grammar that may be useful for future JOIN work, and was copied from the ANSI-SQL-92
documentation.  For example, the `JOIN LATERAL ON | USING` grammar may be useful for lateral joins that will be discussed
briefly in the document below.

The above grammar supports the following use-cases:

#### 6.1.1. Same-table JOIN using the `has_parent` relation:
```sql
FROM table AS tableAlias
JOIN table AS joinTableAlias USING (relation.parent)
```
Where `relation` is the data field mapped as a `join` type, with parent:child, and we want to join on the parent documents
in the relation. Note: if the relation is ambiguous (because more than one relationship is defined for the `parent`), this
syntax will report an error.

#### 6.1.2. Same-table JOIN using the `has_child` relation:
```sql
FROM table AS tableAlias
JOIN table AS joinTableAlias USING (relation.child)
```
Where `relation` is the data field mapped as a `join` type, with `parent:child`, and we want to join on the children documents
in the relation. Note: if the relation is ambiguous (because more than one relationship is defined for the `child`), this
syntax will report an error.

#### 6.1.3. Same-table JOIN using either `has_parnet` or `has_child` relation:
```sql
FROM table AS tableAlias
JOIN table AS joinTableAlias ON (joinTableAlias.relation.parent = tableAlias.relation.child)
```
Where `relation` is the data field mapped as a `join` type, with `parent:child`, and we want to join on parent documents using
the index scan `tableAlias` abd child documents using the index scan `joinTableAlias`.  Note: this syntax is more explicit
that the above syntax and can be used when there are multiple relations defined in the index mapping.

#### 6.1.4. Same-table JOIN using `parent_id` relation:
```sql
FROM table AS tableAlias
JOIN table AS joinTableAlias ON (joinTableAlias.relation.parent = 'myId')
```
Where `relation` is the data field mapped as a `join` type, and we want to join on the parent documents with `_id` equal
to the string `myId`.

### 6.1 Logical Plan Changes - Presentation

The following diagram shows the placement of the `LogicalJoinRelation` as part of the Logical Plan, and the `InnerHitsOperator` 
(name is pending) as part of the physical plan. 

```mermaid

        logState2: LogicalSort
        logState3: LogicalFilter

        phyState1 --> phyState2
        phyState2 --> phyState3
    }
```

### 6.2 Parse Tree Changes

We need to accept JOIN grammar, including `JOIN USING` and `JOIN ON` syntax in the `FROM` clause.  The following diagram
show how the ASTBuilder constructs the `LogicalRelation` object (containing a `Table` or `OpenSearchIndex` object) from 
the Relation clause, which is similar to how the `LogicalJoinRelation` object is constructed from the JoinRelation clause.   

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AstBuilder
    participant FromClauseContext
    participant TableContext
    participant JoinTableContext

    %% node visitor
    AstBuilder->>FromClauseContext: visitFromClause()
    activate FromClauseContext
    FromClauseContext->>TableContext: visitTableAsRelation()
    activate TableContext
    TableContext->>FromClauseContext: Relation
    deactivate TableContext
    FromClauseContext->>JoinTableContext: visitJoinTableAsRelation()
    activate JoinTableContext
    JoinTableContext->>FromClauseContext: Relation.attach(JoinRelation)
    deactivate JoinTableContext
    FromClauseContext->>AstBuilder: UnresolvedPlan
    deactivate FromClauseContext
```

### 6.3 Logical Plan Relation Visitor

    Analyzer->>Analyzer: LogicalRelation.attach(<<LogicalJoinRelation>>)
    Analyzer->>SQLService: LogicalPlan
```

## 7. Detailed-Design Architecture

The LogicalPlan will contain an extra Node called the LogicalJoinRelation, which stores the context
on how the table is self-joined.  We may need to define specific 'types' based on the type
of relationship: parent-child, child-parent, or parent_id.  We will need access to the join datatype
and need to create an `OpenSearchDataType` for joins.

### 7.1 Presentation

ER diagram for how AnalyzerContext contains the TypeEnvironment(s).  The TypeEnvironment defined the 
types (indices and symbols) for each relation environment.  There may be multiple
relations, in the case of joins.  A lateral join will be on the same index or relation, but
the symbol table will be different (through aliasing or otherwise).

The lateralJoin field is new, and will create a separate LogicalJoin node in the Logical Plan. 

```mermaid
erDiagram
    TypeEnvironment {
        TypeEnvironment parent
        TypeEnvironment lateralJoin
        SymbolTable symbolTable
        SymbolTable reservedSymbolTable        
    }
    AnalysisContext {
        TypeEnvironment environment
        List namedParseExpressions
        FunctionProperties functionProperties
    }
    AnalysisContext ||--|| TypeEnvironment : contains-root
    TypeEnvironment ||--o| parent-TypeEnvironment : contains-parent
    parent-TypeEnvironment ||--o| another-TypeEnvironment : contains-parent
    parent-TypeEnvironment ||--o| join-TypeEnvironment : contains-lateralJoin
    
```

The 'Join' type is defined by OpenSearch, and contains the `relation` field
that holds the various parent-child relations.  Note that there can only be 
a single parent, but the parent can have child, or even grand-child relations. 

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class OpenSearchJoinType {
        <<OpenSearchDataType>>
        MappingType mappingType = MappingType.Join
        ExprCoreType exprCoreType = ExprCoreType.JOIN
        OpenSearchRelation parentRelation 
    }
    
    class OpenSearchRelation {
        String relationName
        List<OpenSearchRelation> childrenRelations
    }
    
    OpenSearchJoinType --> OpenSearchRelation
```

The `JoinRelationAnalyzer` creates the `LogicalJoinRelation` from the `Relation` AST nodes. 
There may be more than one `LogicalJoinRelation` created, but they will always
exist as parents to the `LogicalRelation`. 

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class JoinRelationAnalyzer {
        -List~NamedExpression~ namedExpressions
        -ExpressionAnalyzer expressionAnalyzer
        -LogicalPlan child
        +analyze(UnresolvedExpression projectItem, AnalysisContext context) LogicalPlan
        +visitAlias(Alias node, AnalysisContext context) LogicalPlan
        +visitFunction(Function node, AnalysisContext context) LogicalPlan
        -validateArgs(List~UnresolvedExpression~ args)
        -generatePath(String field) ReferenceExpression
    }
```

The LogicalJoinRelation will be of one of 3 types, depending on how the relation is queried
in OpenSearch.  It will use either the `has_parent`, `has_child`, or `parent_id` 
relation queries.  Regardless, these 

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class LogicalJoinRelation {
        -List~NamedExpression~ projectList
        +accept(LogicalPlanNodeVisitor~R_C~ visitor, C context) ~R_C~ R
    }
    
    class LogicalHasParentJoinRelation {
        <<LogicalJoinRelation>>
        parent
    }
    
    class LogicalHasChildJoinRelation {
        <<LogicalJoinRelation>>
        child
    } 
    
    class LogicalByParentIdJoinRelation {
        <<LogicalJoinRelation>>
        parent
        id
    } 
    
    LogicalJoinRelation <|-- LogicalHasParentJoinRelation 
    LogicalJoinRelation <|-- LogicalHasChildJoinRelation 
    LogicalJoinRelation <|-- LogicalByParentIdJoinRelation 
```

The `LogicalJoinRelation` transforms into a `JoinOperator` during the logical-to-physical plan.
The `JoinOperator` takes the form of an `InnerHitsOperator`, as the inner_hits for each join 
relation need to be considered and flattened into the result hits.  This is the same operation 
as the current `NestedOperator`.  The flattening algorithm can be refactored out of the `NestedOperator`
and re-purposed into the `InnerHitsOperator`. 

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class InnerHitsOperator {
        -PhysicalPlan input
        -Set~String~ fields
        -Map~String_List~String~~ groupedPathsAndFields
        -List~Map~String_ExprValue~~ result
        -ListIterator~Map~String_ExprValue~~ flattenedResult

        +accept(PhysicalPlanNodeVisitor~R_C~ visitor, C context) ~R_C~ R
        +getChild() List~PhysicalPlan~
        +hasNext() boolean
        +next() ExprValue
        +generateFlatennedFieldsMap(ExprValue inputMap)
        -flatten(String nestedField, ExprValue row, List~Map~String_ExprValue~~ prevList) List~Map~String_ExprValue~~
        -containsSamePath(Map~String_ExprValue~ newMap) boolean
        -getInnerHitFields(String field, String innerHitField, ExprValue row, List~Map~String_ExprValue~~ ret, ExprValue obj)
    }
    
    InnerHitsOperator <|-- NestedOperator
    InnerHitsOperator <|-- HasParentJoinOperator
    InnerHitsOperator <|-- HasChildJoinOperator
    InnerHitsOperator <|-- ByParentIdJoinOperator
```
